    which captures how different the distributions of real images and generated
    images (or more accurately, their visual features) are. Note that unlike the
    Inception score, this is a true distance and utilizes information about real
    world images.
    Note that when computed using sample means and sample covariance matrices,
    Frechet distance is biased. It is more biased for small sample sizes. (e.g.
    even if the two distributions are the same, for a small sample size, the
    expected Frechet distance is large). It is important to use the same
